				<h2>Roksha</h2>
				<p>Roksha is my first Cat I ever start taking care of myself. He is a great bub. He meows purrs and loves. He does get a bit scared of loud noises and unfamiliar voices though. But when he is comfortable he can be your best bud. He is also great to hug on those rainy days. So he makes for a great support animal. Needless to say I'm very happy I selected him from my local shelter. I was so very close to not choosing him too.</p>

				<h2>Onix</h2>
				<p>Onix is my 2nd cat and also my newest one technically. He is a bit smaller than Roksha and younger but has a bunch of energy. When I got Onix I was looking for a broher for Roksha to be his buddy but I was worried they wouldn't get along. Though, my fears were quickly squashed when I saw them both getting along just fine. They've been buddies since day one. And Onix is always purring no matter how you pick him up.</p>

				<h2>Outdoor Cat</h2>
				<p>Now the Outdoor Cat, or we call him Husky, is a wild cat that started to hang around my house here on the edge of the forest. Im not sure where he came from but he started to live around my back porch. My roomate took him in and we found that he was already nutured and was in good health. But I was advised not to bring him in my house due to the possinblity of deseases. Also, he is a bit teritorial. But he spends his days living on my porch. And I often go out and feed him. And whenever I go outside he is there to give a lot of loving.</p>
